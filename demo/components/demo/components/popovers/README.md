Add non-modal overlays of content next to any element. Popovers can be used to show and behave anyway that you want, thus supporting many use cases, like classic tooltips, opening on click etc.

The popover directives support multiple placements.

Use `<ngl-popover #ref>` to host your popover's content. `#` reference will be later used to "connect" with the desired `nglPopoverTrigger` directive.
