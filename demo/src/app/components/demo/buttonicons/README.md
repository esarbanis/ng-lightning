Buttons icons provide the user with visual iconography that is typically used to invoke an event or action.

An `nglButtonIcon` component represents an icon-only button element that executes an action.

You can use a combination of the `variant` and `size` attributes to customize the button and icon styles. 

Add the `nglButtonState` to turn an `nglButtonIcon` into a stateful component with adding `ngl-state-*` in it.
